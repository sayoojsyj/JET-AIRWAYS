                <h3>The glorious past</h3>
                <hr class="line1">
                <p>Launched in 1993, Jet Airways grew to become synonymous with premium air travel for <br> 
                    discerning travellers in India. It eventually flew to over 65 destinations in India and <br> 
                    across the world, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North America, <br>
                     with hubs in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and gateways in Amsterdam, Paris, London, and <br>
                      Abu Dhabi. It flew 124 narrow-body and wide-body aircraft on nearly 1000 domestic <br>
                       and international routes, before it suspended operations in April 2019.</p>
